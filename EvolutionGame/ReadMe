The rules of The Evolution Game:

We start with n players at level "0" (n should be an even number). In each iteration players are randomly paired and 'fight' in pairs. The result of every 'fight' is completely random (50% / 50% chance). The winner get one level up, the loser: one level down (or stay at the zero level), there is no draw option. The level of each participant is updated, and we may start a new iteration. 
The game goes on unitil we get the winner (at least one player reaches the max level) or a specified number of iterations were performed. Final statistics are saved to file given by the user

Input parameters:
    n - number of playerd (odd number)
    max_level 
    number_of_iterations
    filename - file in which final statistics are saved 


Two independent versions of the program: main.py and main.ipynb
